# CyberVulnX — AI Prompt Injection Lab

A CTF-style lab where an AI assistant ("VaultBot") is told to guard a secret
flag and never reveal it. The user wins by crafting a prompt that gets the
model to leak the flag anyway — classic prompt-injection / jailbreak practice.

Same look, header, and footer as the Stored XSS lab — only the middle section
and lab logic changed.

## How it works

1. `backend/app.py` keeps a `FLAG` (env var, defaults to a sample value) inside
   a system prompt for VaultBot, along with instructions never to reveal it.
2. Every message you send goes to `/api/chat`, which forwards it to Groq's
   Llama 3.3 70B model along with that system prompt.
3. If the model's reply contains the flag, the backend flips `solved = true`
   and the frontend shows the success banner with the captured flag.
4. "Reset" clears local state and tells the backend to reset `solved`.

## Setup

```bash
# backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env       
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py                # runs on :5000

# frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                  # runs on :5173, proxies /api to :5000
```

Or run `./build.sh` to build the frontend for production and install backend
deps in one go (same as the original lab).

## Difficulty

Medium. VaultBot is instructed to refuse direct asks, refuse roleplay/"dev
mode" framing, and refuse partial/encoded leaks. It's crackable with a solid
prompt-injection technique, not on the first try.
